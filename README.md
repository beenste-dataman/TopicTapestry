## Introduction

TopicTapestry is a one stop bulk file handling shop. It sifts through your file names and leverages LDA to categorize them into distinct topics. Whether you're diving into a fresh dataset or revisiting a previous one, TopicTapestry provides a one-stop solution to analyze and make sense of your data.

## Features
- 🗂️ Sort and gather files by type from your unsorted files. Neatly Pack into one directory.
- 🌍 Translate filenames in bulk to English for LDA step. (or translate to any preferred language if this is the only step you want to do)
- 📊 Perform LDA analysis on file names.
- 🗂️ Create a CSV flat file database for easy examination.
- 🚀 Quick file retrieval based on topics of interest.
- 🎨 Visualize topic distributions with an interactive HTML dashboard output.

## Getting Started

**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beenste-dataman/TopicTapestry.git &&
   sudo chmod -R 777 TopicTapestry &&
   cd TopicTapestry
```

**Run TopicTapestry**
```
python topic_tapestry.py
```

## Usage

- **Sort and Gather Files**

Use the sort option to recursively sort files by filetype from your system. 

This copies them to a bulk target directory. The LDA script takes only a bulk directory as input, no subdirectories. So, this creates a clean bucket for the LDA script to run on. 
I use this script on massive datasets, and love it. It allows me to bucket unmanageable datasets into neat buckets. Then proceed to topic model them using LDA in steps 2-3. Analyze terabytes like they are putty in your hand. 

- **Translate filenames in bulk**

  You can bulk translate filenames from most languages to English for LDA. LDA only works in English for English search. But, this section of the framework is the one I often use outside of the framework. You can use this as a separate tool as needed. 


- **Perform LDA Analysis**

Upon running runner.py, select the option to perform LDA analysis. (This is not a recursive tool, use the sorting tool to make a bucket to feed it)
The script will guide you through the process. If you used the sorting script feed it that bucket directory you created.


- **Query prior Results**

Opt to query an existing CSV file.
Enter the topic words of interest.
Access the relevant files directly through the tool. Quickly open and read related files. 

- **Access The Interactive HTML Topic Modelling Output Dashboard**

Choose the option for this and the dashboard will open in browser.
